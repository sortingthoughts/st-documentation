## Quick Start Desktop Version

**Step 1: Installation**

Download Sorting Thoughts for Windows or macOS from the [download page](https://www.sortingthoughts.de/blog/download/) and follow the [installation instructions](installation.md). Sorting Thoughts is offered as shareware, which means the basic functions can be used indefinitely for free. To use all  functions, a registration code must be purchased. More information can be found here: [Buy Sorting Thoughts](https://www.sortingthoughts.de/blog/buy-sorting-thoughts/). Before you buy Sorting Thoughts you should test all features, except the sync service, for 30 days. You can find the trial code on this page: [Test Sorting Thoughts](https://www.sortingthoughts.de/blog/test-sorting-thoughts/).

**Step 2: Create a thought library and collection**

Any thoughts that you recorded with Sorting Thoughts will be stored in an encrypted thoughts library.

After the first start you will be prompted to create a thought library. For this purpose it is necessary to specify a directory where the thoughts library should be saved. In addition, a password must be chosen.

A thought library is the case for several thoughts collections, which are in turn protected by a username and password.

The credentials for the library and collections are very important because just so access may be granted. Further information is available in the [User's Guide](/handbuch/gedanken_bibliothek.md).

**Note: Please memorize your login credentials. There is no password reminder - only you know the password!**

**Step 4: Create the first thought**

After a collection has been created, a new thought can be created from the menu or by pressing the key combination "Ctrl + N" or under macOS "Command + N". Further information is available in the [User's Guide](/handbuch/gedanken_verwalten.md).
