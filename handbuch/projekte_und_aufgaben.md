## Project and task management

In addition to simple thoughts, it is also possible to create and manage projects, tasks and events with Sorting Thoughts. These special thoughts have additional input fields and metadata.

### Projects

Each project thought in the desktop version has a **Task Schedule** view that visualizes all sub-tasks of the project in a Gantt chart. It is also possible to plan tasks in the Gantt chart by shifting them in time. You can open the tasks directly by double-clicking on a task bar.

The metadata of a project thought has an extra section that provides information about how long the project was in what status and how many subtasks the project has.
